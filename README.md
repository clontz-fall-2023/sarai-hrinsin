I am a Mathematics and Statistics major with a Finance minor at the University of South Alabama. I am a senior this year and I have done numerous projects including game theory applied to traffic conjestion and the history of fibonacci numbers being applied to societal beauty standards. I hope to go into Financial software development and advance the industry of money markets through technology.
